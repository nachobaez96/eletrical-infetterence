# Eletrical Infetterence

Eletrical Infetterence is a WIP Elementary-powered VST audio plug-in that runs on your DAW.

It's based on SRVB and currently serves as a glorified tremolo effect.

Coming next are different modes and rhythmic features expanding on the idea of amp power going out and back.
